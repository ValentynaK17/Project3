# Book Recommendation Platform : Project3
In this project, we are analyzing and visualizing popularity of different Authors based on User ratings of Books. The data is in the form of 3 CSV files : Users, Ratings, Books.

The project can be run using following steps:
1. Database Setup - Run Jupyter Notebook DB_setup.ipynb to get the merged data
2. Running the Flask Application - Run the app.py file to get the jsonified data
3. Interactive Visualizations - The html page will by default display a Dashboard with a Bar Chart : Top 10 Authors showing Average Rating Score, Quadrant Analysis for the default selected Author from the dropdown. There are options to change the charts using Radio Buttons and change the Author using provided dropdown
